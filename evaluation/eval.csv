What does the odb module in OpenROAD stand for?,OpenROAD is run using Tcl scripts. The following commands are used to read\
and write design data.  \
Use the Tcl `source` command to read commands from a file.  \
If an error is encountered in a command while reading the command file\,\
then the error is printed and no more commands are read from the file. If\
`file_continue_on_error` is `1` then OpenROAD will continue reading commands\
after the error.  \
If `exit_on_error` is `1` then OpenROAD will exit when it encounters an error.  \
OpenROAD can be used to make a OpenDB database from LEF/DEF\, or Verilog\
(flat or hierarchical). Once the database is made it can be saved as a file\
with the `write_db` command. OpenROAD can then read the database with the\
`read_db` command without reading LEF/DEF or Verilog.  \
The `read_lef` and `read_def` commands can be used to build an OpenDB database\
as shown below. The `read_lef -tech` flag reads the technology portion of a\
LEF file.  The `read_lef -library` flag reads the MACROs in the LEF file.\
If neither of the `-tech` and `-library` flags are specified they default\
to `-tech -library` if no technology has been read and `-library` if a\
technology exists in the database.  \
The `read_verilog` command is used to build an OpenDB database as shown\
below. Multiple Verilog files for a hierarchical design can be read.\
The `link_design` command is used to flatten the design and make a database.,\
