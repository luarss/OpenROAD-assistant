    "- Clean your data. Make sure it is content only and no extraneous tags.\n",
    "- Explore different index types. Perhaps can use keyword based search for certain items, and llamaindex based for others.\n",
    "- Experiment with chunking approach. Suggest to write up individual functions and then combine them into a main file for experiments. (for loop)\n",
    "- Play around with your base prompt. Once again, can use an experiment. Refer to the prompt guide [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11382)\n",
    "- Do meta-data filtering. Gitloader currently doesn't consider date. But there should be a way to obtain last modified.\n",
    "-  Use query routing. It's useful to have more than one index. For e.g. one that handles the summaries, one that answers flow questions etc. OR just come up with two separate chatbots.\n",
    "- Look into reranking. It is one solution to the issue of discrepancy between similarity and relevance.\n",
    "- Look into transforming the user's query further. [HyDE](https://github.com/texttron/hyde) takes a query, generates a hypothetical response, and then uses both for embedding look up. This can improve performance. [*note that they use GPT3, but we can simply prompt the LLM one more time.*]\n",
    "- Fine-tune your **embedding model**. The embedding model might not be well-suited to our target domain. So we can improve retrieval by fine-tuning first.\n",
    "- Use LLM evaluation frameworks: Langchain-Evaluate, RAGAS"
