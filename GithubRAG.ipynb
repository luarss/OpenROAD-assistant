       " Document(page_content='# Welcome to OpenROAD\\'s documentation!\\n\\nThe OpenROAD (\"Foundations and Realization of Open, Accessible Design\")\\nproject was launched in June 2018 within the DARPA IDEA program. OpenROAD\\naims to bring down the barriers of cost, expertise and unpredictability that\\ncurrently block designers\\' access to hardware implementation in advanced\\ntechnologies. The project team (Qualcomm, Arm and multiple universities and\\npartners, led by UC San Diego) is developing a fully autonomous, open-source\\ntool chain for digital SoC layout generation, focusing on\\nthe RTL-to-GDSII phase of system-on-chip design. Thus,\\nOpenROAD holistically attacks the multiple facets of today\\'s design cost\\ncrisis: engineering resources, design tool licenses, project schedule,\\nand risk.\\n\\nThe IDEA program targets no-human-in-loop (NHIL) design, with 24-hour\\nturnaround time and zero loss of power-performance-area (PPA) design quality.\\n\\nThe NHIL target requires tools to adapt and auto-tune successfully to flow\\ncompletion, without (or, with minimal) human intervention. Machine\\nintelligence augments human expertise through efficient modeling and\\nprediction of flow and optimization outcomes throughout the synthesis, placement\\nand routing process. This is complemented by development of metrics\\nand machine learning infrastructure.\\n\\nThe 24-hour runtime target implies that problems must be strategically\\ndecomposed throughout the design process, with clustered and partitioned\\nsubproblems being solved and recomposed through intelligent distribution\\nand management of computational resources. This ensures that the NHIL design\\noptimization is performed within its available `[threads * hours]` \"box\" of\\nresources. Decomposition that enables parallel and distributed search over\\ncloud resources incurs a quality-of-results loss, but this is subsequently\\nrecovered through improved flow predictability and enhanced optimization.\\n\\nFor a technical description of the OpenROAD flow, please refer to our DAC-2019 paper:\\n[Toward an Open-Source Digital Flow: First Learnings from the OpenROAD Project](https://vlsicad.ucsd.edu/Publications/Conferences/371/c371.pdf).\\nThe paper is also available from [ACM Digital Library](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3316781.3326334).\\nOther publications and presentations are\\nlinked [here](https://theopenroadproject.org/publications/).\\n\\n## Documentation\\n\\nThe OpenROAD Project has two releases:\\n\\n- Application ([github](https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenROAD)) ([docs](main/README.md)): The application is a standalone binary for digital place and route that can be used by any other RTL-GDSII flow controller.\\n- Flow ([github](https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenROAD-flow-scripts)) ([docs](https://openroad-flow-scripts.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)): This is the native OpenROAD flow that consists of a set of integrated scripts for an autonomous RTL-GDSII flow using OpenROAD and other open-source tools.\\n\\n## Code of conduct\\n\\nPlease read our code of conduct [here](main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).\\n\\n## How to contribute\\n\\nIf you are willing to **contribute**, see the\\n[Getting Involved](contrib/GettingInvolved.md) section.\\n\\nIf you are a **developer** with EDA background, learn more about how you\\ncan use OpenROAD as the infrastructure for your tools in the\\n[Developer Guide](contrib/DeveloperGuide.md) section.\\n\\nOpenROAD uses Git for version control and contributions. \\nGet familiarised with a quickstart tutorial to contribution [here](contrib/GitGuide.md).\\n\\n## How to get in touch\\n\\nWe maintain the following channels for communication:\\n\\n-   Project homepage and news: <https://theopenroadproject.org>\\n-   Twitter: <https://twitter.com/OpenROAD_EDA>\\n-   Issues and bugs:\\n    -   OpenROAD: <https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenROAD/issues>\\n-   Discussions:\\n    -   OpenROAD: <https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenROAD/discussions>\\n-   Inquiries: openroad@eng.ucsd.edu\\n\\nSee also our [FAQs](user/FAQS.md).\\n\\n## Site Map\\n\\n```{tableofcontents}\\n```', metadata={'source': 'docs/index.md', 'file_path': 'docs/index.md', 'file_name': 'index.md', 'file_type': '.md'}),\n",

       " Document(page_content=\"# Coding Practices\\n\\nList of coding practices.\\n\\n:::{Note}\\nThis is a compilation of many idioms in OpenROAD code that are considered undesirable. \\n:::\\n\\n## C++\\n\\n### Practice #1\\n\\nDon't comment out code, instead remove it.\\n`git` provides a complete history of\\nthe code if you want to look backwards. Huge chunks of commented-out\\ncode make it difficult to read.\\n\\n### Practice #2\\n\\nDon't use prefixes on function names or variables. That's what\\nnamespaces are for.\\n\\n``` cpp\\nnamespace fr {\\n  class frConstraint\\n  class frLef58CutClassConstraint\\n  class frShortConstraint\\n  class frNonSufficientMetalConstraint\\n  class frOffGridConstraint\\n  class frMinEnclosedAreaConstraint\\n  class frMinStepConstraint\\n  class frMinimumcutConstraint\\n  class frAreaConstraint\\n  class frMinWidthConstraint\\n  class frLef58SpacingEndOfLineWithinEndToEndConstraint\\n  class frLef58SpacingEndOfLineWithinParallelEdgeConstraint\\n  class frLef58SpacingEndOfLineWithinMaxMinLengthConstraint\\n  class frLef58SpacingEndOfLineWithinConstraint\\n  class frLef58SpacingEndOfLineConstraint\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### Practice #3\\n\\nNamespaces should be all lower case and short. This is an example of a\\npoor choice: `namespace TritonCTS`\\n\\n### Practice #4\\n\\nDon't use `extern` on function definitions. It is pointless\\nin a world with prototypes.\\n\\n``` cpp\\nnamespace fr {\\n  extern frCoord getGCELLGRIDX();\\n  extern frCoord\\n  getGCELLGRIDY();\\n  extern frCoord getGCELLOFFSETX();\\n  extern frCoord\\n  getGCELLOFFSETY();\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### Practice #5\\n\\nDon't use prefixes on file names. That's what directories are for.\\n\\n``` shell\\nfrDRC.h frDRC_init.cpp frDRC_main.cpp frDRC_setup.cpp frDRC_util.cpp\\n```\\n\\n### Practice #6\\n\\nDon't name variables `theThingy`, `curThingy` or `myThingy`. It is just\\ndistracting extraneous verbiage. Just use `thingy`.\\n\\n``` cpp\\nfloat currXSize;\\nfloat currYSize;\\nfloat currArea;\\nfloat currWS;\\nfloat currWL;\\nfloat currWLnoWts;\\n```\\n\\n### Practice #7\\n\\nDo not use global variables. All state should be inside of classes.\\nGlobal variables make multi-threading next to impossible and preclude\\nhaving multiple copies of a tool running in the same process. The only\\nglobal variable in `openroad` should be the singleton that Tcl commands\\nreference.\\n\\n``` cpp\\nextern std::string DEF_FILE;\\nextern std::string GUIDE_FILE;\\nextern std::string OUTGUIDE_FILE;\\nextern std::string LEF_FILE;\\nextern std::string OUTTA_FILE;\\nextern std::string OUT_FILE;\\nextern std::string DBPROCESSNODE;\\nextern std::string OUT_MAZE_FILE;\\nextern std::string DRC_RPT_FILE;\\nextern int MAX_THREADS ;\\nextern int VERBOSE ;\\nextern int BOTTOM_ROUTING_LAYER;\\nextern bool ALLOW_PIN_AS_FEEDTHROUGH;\\nextern bool USENONPREFTRACKS;\\nextern bool USEMINSPACING_OBS;\\nextern bool RESERVE_VIA_ACCESS;\\nextern bool ENABLE_BOUNDARY_MAR_FIX;\\n```\\n\\n### Practice #8\\n\\nDo not use strings (names) to refer to database or sta objects except in\\nuser interface code. DEF, SDC, and Verilog all use different names for\\nnetlist instances and nets, so the names will not always match.\\n\\n### Practice #9\\n\\nDo not use continue. Wrap the body in an if instead.\\n\\n``` cpp\\n// instead of\\nfor(dbInst* inst : block->getInsts() ) {\\n  // Skip for standard cells\\n  if (inst->getBBox()->getDY() <= cellHeight) { continue; }\\n  // code\\n}\\n// use\\nfor(dbInst* inst : block->getInsts() ){\\n  // Skip for standard cells\\n  if (inst->getBBox()->getDY() > cellHeight) {\\n    // code\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### Practice #10\\n\\nDon't put magic numbers in the code. Use a variable with a name that\\ncaptures the intent. Document the units if they exist.\\n\\n``` cpp\\nreferenceHpwl_= 446000000;\\ncoeffV = 1.36;\\ncoeffV = 1.2;\\ndouble nearest_dist = 99999999999;\\nif (dist < rowHeight * 2) {}\\nfor(int i = 9; i > -1; i--) {}\\nif(design_util > 0.6 || num_fixed_nodes > 0) div = 1;\\navail_region_area += (theRect->xUR - theRect->xLL - (int)theRect->xUR % 200 + (int)t  heRect->xLL % 200 - 200) * (theRect->yUR - theRect->yLL - (int)theRect->yUR % 2000 + (int)theRect->yLL % 2000 - 2000);\\n```\\n\\n### Practice #11\\n\\nDon't copy code fragments.

Use `new`. We are writing C++, not C.\\n\\n### Practice #14\\n\\nDon\\'t use C style arrays. There is no bounds checks for them so they\\ninvite subtle memory errors to unwitting programmers who fail to use\\n`valgrind`. Use `std::vector` or `std::array`.\\n\\n### Practice #15\\n\\nBreak long functions into smaller ones, preferably that fit on one\\nscreen.\\n\\n### Practice #16\\n\\nDon\\'t reinvent functions like `round`, `floor`, `abs`, `min`, `max`. Use the std\\nversions.\\n\\n``` cpp\\nint size_x = (int)floor(theCell->width / wsite + 0.5);\\n```\\n\\n### Practice #17\\n\\nDon\\'t use C\\'s stdlib.h `abs`, `fabs` or `fabsf`. They fail miserably if the\\nwrong arg type is passed to them. Use `std::abs`.\\n\\n### Practice #18\\n\\nFold code common to multiple loops into the same loop. Each of these\\nfunctions loops over every instance like this:\\n\\n``` cpp\\nlegal &= row_check(log);\\nlegal &= site_check(log);\\nfor(int i = 0; i < cells.size(); i++) {\\n  cell* theCell = &cells[i];\\n  legal &= power_line_check(log);\\n  legal &= edge_check(log);\\n  legal &= placed_check(log);\\n  legal &= overlap_check(log);\\n}\\n// with this loop\\nfor(int i = 0; i < cells.size(); i++) {\\n  cell* theCell = &cells[i];\\n}\\n```\\n\\nInstead make one pass over the instances doing each check.\\n\\n### Practice #19\\n\\nDon\\'t use `== true`, or `== false`. Boolean expressions already have a\\nvalue of true or false.\\n\\n``` cpp\\nif(found.first == true) {\\n  // code\\n}\\n// is simply\\nif(found.first) {\\n  // code\\n}\\n// and\\nif(found.first == false) {\\n  // code\\n}\\n// is simply\\nif(!found.first) {\\n // code\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### Practice #20\\n\\nDon\\'t nest if statements.

       " Document(page_content='# Database Math 101\\n\\n## Introduction\\n\\nDEF defines the units it uses with the `UNITS` command.\\n\\n```\\n    UNITS DISTANCE MICRONS 1000 ;\\n```\\n\\nTypically the units are 1000 or 2000 database units (DBU) per micron.\\nDBUs are integers, so the distance resolution is typically 0.001 um or\\n1nm.\\n\\nOpenDB uses an `int` to represent a DBU, which on most hardware is 4\\nbytes. This means a database coordinate can be $\\\\pm 2147483647$, which is\\nabout $2 \\\\cdot 10^9$ units, corresponding to $2 \\\\cdot 10^6$ or $2$ meters.\\n\\n## Datatype Choice\\n\\nThis section is important as we cover important math considerations for\\nyour datatype choice when dealing with large numbers.\\n\\n### Why not pure int?\\n\\nSince chip coordinates cannot be negative, it would make sense to use an\\n`unsigned int` to represent a distance. This conveys the fact that it\\ncan never be negative and doubles the maximum possible distance that can\\nbe represented. The problem, however, is that doing subtraction with unsigned numbers\\nis dangerous because the differences can be negative. An unsigned\\nnegative number looks like a very very big number. So this is a very bad\\nidea and leads to bugs.\\n\\nNote that calculating an area with `int` values is problematic. An\\n`int * int` does not fit in an `int`. **Our suggestion is to use `int64_t`\\nin this situation.** Although `long` \"works\", its size is implementation-dependent.\\n\\n### Why not double?\\n\\nIt has been noticed that some programs use `double` to calculate distances. \\nThis can be problematic, as `double` have a mantissa of 52 bits, which means that \\nthe largest possible integer value that can be represented without loss is $5\\\\cdot 10^{15}$.\\nThis is 12 bits less than the largest possible integer value that can be represented \\nby an `int64_t`. As a result, if you are doing an area calculation on a large chip \\nthat is more than $\\\\sqrt{5\\\\cdot 10^{15}} = 7\\\\cdot 10^7\\\\ DBU$ on a side, the mantissa of the \\ndouble will overflow and the result will be truncated.\\n\\nNot only is a `double` less capable than an `int64_t`, but using it\\ntells any reader of the code that the value can be a real number, such as\\n$104.23$. So it is extremely misleading.\\n\\n### Use int only for LEF/DEF Distances\\n\\nCircling back to LEF, we see that unlike DEF the distances are real\\nnumbers like 1.3 even though LEF also has a distance unit statement. We\\nsuspect this is a historical artifact of a mistake made in the early\\ndefinition of the LEF file format. The reason it is a mistake is because\\ndecimal fractions cannot be represented exactly in binary floating-point.\\nFor example, $1.1 = 1.00011001100110011...$, a continued fraction.\\n\\nOpenDB uses `int` to represent LEF distances, just as with DEF. This solves\\nthe problem by multiplying distances by a decimal constant (distance\\nunits) to convert the distance to an integer. In the future I would like\\nto see OpenDB use a `dbu` typedef instead of `int` everywhere.\\n\\n### Why not float?\\n\\nWe have also noticed RePlAce, OpenDP, TritonMacroPlace and OpenNPDN all using\\n`double` or `float` to represent distances. This can be problematic, as \\nfloating-point numbers cannot always represent exact fractions. As a result,\\nthese tools need to `round` or `floor` the results of their calculations, which \\ncan introduce errors. Additionally, some of these tools reinvent the wheel \\nby implementing their own rounding functions, as we shall see in the example below.\\nThis can lead to inconsistencies and is highly discouraged.\\n\\n```cpp\\n(int) x_coord + 0.5\\n```\\n\\nWorse than using a `double` is using a `float`, because the mantissa\\nis only 23 bits, so the maximum exactly representable integer is $8\\\\cdot 10^6$.\\nThis makes it even less capable than an `int`.\\n\\nWhen a value has to be snapped to a grid such as the pitch of a layer,\\nthe calculation can be done with a simple divide using `int`, which\\n`floor` the result. For example, to snap a coordinate to the pitch of a\\nlayer the following can be used:', metadata={'source': 'docs/contrib/DatabaseMath.md', 'file_path': 'docs/contrib/DatabaseMath.md', 'file_name': 'DatabaseMath.md', 'file_type': '.md'}),\n",

Results like $5.99999999992$ need to be \"fixed\".\\nThis problem does not exist if fixed-point arithmetic is used.', metadata={'source': 'docs/contrib/DatabaseMath.md', 'file_path': 'docs/contrib/DatabaseMath.md', 'file_name': 'DatabaseMath.md', 'file_type': '.md'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='# Developer Guide\\n\\n## Tool Philosophy\\n\\nOpenROAD is a tool to build a chip from synthesizable RTL (Verilog) to\\ncompleted physical layout (manufacturable, tapeout-clean GDSII).\\n\\nThe unifying principle behind the design of OpenROAD is for all of the\\ntools to reside in one tool, with one process, and one database. All\\ntools in the flow should use Tcl commands exclusively to control them\\ninstead of external \"configuration files\". File-based communication\\nbetween tools and forking processes is strongly discouraged. This\\narchitecture streamlines the construction of a flexible tool flow and\\nminimizes the overhead of invoking each tool in the flow.\\n\\n## Tool File Organization\\n\\nEvery tool follows the following file structure, grouping sources, tests\\nand headers together.\\n\\n- `src/`\\n   This folder contains the source files for individual tools.\\n \\n| `src`           | Purpose |\\n|-----------------|--------------|\\n| `CMakeLists.txt`  | `add_subdirectory` for each tool|\\n| `tool/src`       | sources and private headers |\\n| `tool/src/CMakeLists.txt` | tool specific CMake file |\\n| `tool/include/tool` | exported headers |\\n| `tool/test`       | tool tests |\\n| `tool/regression` | tool unit tests|\\n\\n- OpenROAD repository:\\n  This folder contains the top-level files for overall compilation. OpenROAD uses [swig](https://swig.org/) that acts as a wrapper for C/C++ programs to be callable in higher-level languages, such as Python and Tcl.\\n\\n| `OpenROAD`      | Purpose |\\n|-----------------|--------------|\\n| `CMakeLists.txt` | top-level CMake file |\\n| `src/Main.cc`   | main file  |\\n| `src/OpenROAD.cc` | OpenROAD class functions |\\n| `src/OpenROAD.i`  | top-level swig, includes, tool swig files |\\n| `src/OpenROAD.tcl` | basic read/write lef/def/db commands |\\n| `include/ord/OpenROAD.hh` | OpenROAD top-level class, has instances of tools |\\n\\nSome tools such as OpenSTA are submodules, which are simply\\nsubdirectories in `src/` that are pointers to the git submodule. They are\\nintentionally not segregated into a separate module.\\n\\nThe use of submodules for new code integrated into OpenROAD is strongly\\ndiscouraged. Submodules make changes to the underlying infrastructure\\n(e.g., OpenSTA) difficult to propagate across the dependent submodule\\nrepositories.\\n\\nWhere external/third-party code that a tool depends on should be placed\\ndepends on the nature of the dependency.\\n\\n-   Libraries - code packaged as a linkable library. Examples are `tcl`,\\n    `boost`, `zlib`, `eigen`, `lemon`, `spdlog`.\\n\\nThese should be installed in the build environment and linked by\\nOpenROAD. Document these dependencies in the top-level `README.md` file.\\nThe `Dockerfile` should be updated to illustrate where to find the library\\nand how to install it. Adding libraries to the build environment requires\\ncoordination with system administrators, so that continuous integration hosts ensure\\nthat environments include the dependency. Advance notification\\nshould also be given to the development team so that their private build\\nenvironments can be updated.\\n\\nEach tool CMake file builds a library that is linked by the OpenROAD\\napplication. The tools should not define a `main()` function. If the\\ntool is Tcl only and has no C++ code, it does not need to have a CMake\\nfile. Tool CMake files should **not** include the following:\\n\\n- `cmake_minimum_required`\\n- `GCC_COVERAGE_COMPILE_FLAGS`\\n- `GCC_COVERAGE_LINK_FLAGS`\\n- `CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS`\\n- `CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS`\\n\\nNone of the tools have commands to read or write LEF, DEF, Verilog or\\ndatabase files. For consistency, these functions are all provided by the OpenROAD\\nframework.\\n\\nTools should package all of their state in a single class. An instance of each\\ntool class resides in the top-level OpenROAD object. This allows\\nmultiple tools to exist at the same time. If any tool keeps state in\\nglobal variables (even static), then only one tool can exist at a time. Many\\nof the tools being integrated were not built with this goal in mind and\\nwill only work on one design at a time.', metadata={'source': 'docs/contrib/DeveloperGuide.md', 'file_path': 'docs/contrib/DeveloperGuide.md', 'file_name': 'DeveloperGuide.md', 'file_type': '.md'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Each tool should use a unique namespace for all of its code. The same\\nnamespace should be used for Tcl functions, including those defined by a\\nswig interface file. Internal Tcl commands stay inside the namespace,\\nand user visible Tcl commands should be defined in the global namespace.\\nUser commands should be simple Tcl commands such as `global_placement`\\nthat do not create tool instances that must be based to the commands.\\nDefining Tcl commands for a tool class is fine for internal commands, but not\\nfor user visible commands. Commands have an implicit argument of the\\ncurrent OpenROAD class object. Functions to get individual tools from\\nthe OpenROAD object can be defined.\\n\\n## Initialization (C++ tools only)\\n\\nThe OpenROAD class has pointers to each tool, with functions to get each\\ntool. Each tool has (at a minimum) a function to make an instance of the\\ntool class, an initialization function that is called after all of\\nthe tools have been made, and a function to delete the tool. This small\\nheader does **not** include the class definition for the tool so that\\nthe OpenROAD framework does not have to know anything about the tool\\ninternals or include a gigantic header file.\\n\\n`MakeTool.hh` defines the following:\\n\\n``` cpp\\nTool *makeTool();\\nvoid initTool(OpenRoad *openroad);\\nvoid deleteTool(Tool *tool);\\n```\\n\\nThe `OpenRoad::init()` function calls all of the `makeTool` functions and\\nthen all of the `initTool()` functions. The `init` functions are called from\\nthe bottom of the tool dependencies. Each `init` function grabs the state\\nit needs out of the `OpenRoad` instance.\\n\\n## Commands\\n\\nTools should provide Tcl commands to control them. Tcl object based tool\\ninterfaces are not user-friendly. Define Tcl procedures that take\\nkeyword arguments that reference the `OpenRoad` object to get tool state.\\nOpenSTA has Tcl utilities to parse keyword arguments\\n(`sta::parse_keyword_args`). See `OpenSTA/tcl/*.tcl` for\\nexamples. Use swig to define internal functions to C++ functionality.\\n\\nTcl files can be included by encoding them in CMake into a string that\\nis evaluated at run time (See [`Resizer::init()`](../main/src/rsz/src/Resizer.cc)).\\n\\n## Errors\\n\\nTools should report errors to the user using the `ord::error` function\\ndefined in `include/openroad/Error.hh`. `ord::error` throws\\n`ord::Exception`. The variables `ord::exit_on_error` and\\n`ord::file_continue_on_error` control how the error is handled. If\\n`ord::exit_on_error` is `true` then OpenROAD reports the error and exits. If\\nthe error is encountered while reading a file with the `source` or\\n`read_sdc` commands and `ord::file_continue_on_error` is `false` then no\\nother commands are read from the file. The default value is `false` for both\\nvariables.\\n\\n## Test\\n\\nEach \"tool\" has a `/test` directory containing a script named\\n`regression` to run \"unit\" tests. With no arguments it should run\\ndefault unit tests.\\n\\nNo database files should be in tests. Read LEF/DEF/Verilog to make a\\ndatabase.\\n\\nThe regression script should not depend on the current working\\ndirectory. It should be able to be run from any directory. Use filenames\\nrelative to the script name rather the current working directory.\\n\\nRegression scripts should print a concise summary of test failures. The\\nregression script should return an exit code of 0 if there are no\\nerrors and 1 if there are errors. The script should **not** print\\nthousands of lines of internal tool information.\\n\\nRegression scripts should pass the `-no_init` option to `openroad` so that\\na user\\'s `init` file is not sourced before the tests runs.\\n\\nRegression scripts should add output files or directories to\\n`.gitignore` so that running does not leave the source repository\\n\"dirty\".\\n\\nThe Nangate45 open-source library data used by many tests is in\\n`test/Nangate45`.

       " Document(page_content='# Getting Involved\\n\\nThank you for taking the time to read this document and to contribute.\\nThe OpenROAD project will not reach all of its objectives without help!\\n\\nPossible ways to contribute to the OpenROAD application:\\n\\n- Tool improvements\\n- New tools\\n- Improvements to documentation, including this document\\n- Star our project and repos so we can see the number of people\\n    who are interested\\n\\n## Licensing Contributions\\n\\nAs much as possible, all contributions should be licensed using the BSD3\\nlicense. You can propose another license if you must, but contributions\\nmade with BSD3 fit best with the spirit of OpenROAD\\'s permissive open-source\\nphilosophy. We do have exceptions in the project, but over time we hope\\nthat all contributions will be BSD3, or some other permissive license such as MIT\\nor Apache2.0.\\n\\n## Contributing Scripts and Code\\n\\nWe follow the [Google C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).\\nIf you find code in our project that does *not* follow this guide, then within each file that\\nyou edit, follow the style in that file.\\n\\nPlease pay careful attention to the\\n[tool checklist](DeveloperGuide.md#tool-checklist) for all code. If you want\\nto add or improve functionality in OpenROAD, please start with the\\ntop-level [app](https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenROAD/) repo. You\\ncan see in the `src` directory that submodules exist pointing to tested\\nversions of the other relevant repos in the project. Please look at the\\ntool workflow in the developer guide [document](DeveloperGuide.md)\\nto work with the app and its submodule repos in an efficient way.\\n\\nPlease run clang-format on all the C++ source files that you change, before\\ncommitting. In the root directory of the OpenROAD repository there is the\\nfile `.clang-format` that defines all coding formatting rules.\\n\\nPlease pay attention to the\\n[test directory](https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenROAD/tree/master/test)\\nand be sure to add tests for any code changes that you make, using open-source\\nPDK and design information. We provide the `nangate45` PDK in\\nthe OpenROAD-flow-scripts repo to help with this. Pull requests with\\ncode changes are unlikely to be accepted without accompanying test\\ncases. There are many\\n[examples](https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenROAD/blob/master/test/gcd_nangate45.tcl)\\ntests. Each repo has a test directory as well with tests you should run\\nand add to if you modify something in one of the submodules.\\n\\nFor changes that claim to improve QoR or PPA, please run many tests and\\nensure that the improvement is not design-specific. There are designs in\\nthe\\n[OpenROAD-flow-scripts](https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenROAD-flow-scripts/)\\nrepo which can be used unless the improvement is technology-specific.\\n\\nDo not add runtime or build dependencies without serious thought. For a\\nproject like OpenROAD with many application subcomponents, the software\\narchitecture can quickly get out of control. Changes with lots of new\\ndependencies which are not necessary are less likely to be integrated.\\n\\nIf you want to add Tcl code to define a new tool command, look at [pdngen](https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenROAD/tree/master/src/pdn)\\nas an example of how to do so. Take a look at the\\n[CMake file](https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenROAD/blob/master/src/CMakeLists.txt)\\nwhich automatically sources the Tcl code and the\\n[Tcl file](https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenROAD/blob/master/src/pdn/src/pdn.tcl)\\nitself.\\n\\nTo accept contributions, we require each commit to be made with a DCO (Developer\\nCertificate of Origin) attached.\\nWhen you commit you add the `-s` flag to your commit. For example:\\n\\n``` shell\\ngit commit -s -m \"test dco with -s\"\\n```', metadata={'source': 'docs/contrib/GettingInvolved.md', 'file_path': 'docs/contrib/GettingInvolved.md', 'file_name': 'GettingInvolved.md', 'file_type': '.md'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='``` shell\\ngit commit -s -m \"test dco with -s\"\\n```\\n\\nThis will append a statement to your commit comment that attests to the DCO. GitHub\\nhas built in the `-s` option to its command line since use of this is so\\npervasive. The promise is very basic, certifying that you know that you\\nhave the right to commit the code. Please read the  [full statement\\nhere](https://developercertificate.org/).\\n\\n## Questions\\n\\nPlease refer to our [FAQs](../user/FAQS.md).', metadata={'source': 'docs/contrib/GettingInvolved.md', 'file_path': 'docs/contrib/GettingInvolved.md', 'file_name': 'GettingInvolved.md', 'file_type': '.md'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='# Git Quickstart\\n\\nThis tutorial serves as a quickstart to Git and contributing to our repository. If you have not already set up OpenROAD, please follow the instructions [here](user/Build.md). \\n\\n```{tip} This basic tutorial gives instruction for basic password Git authentication.\\nIf you would like to setup SSH authentication, please follow this [guide](https://help.github.com/set-up-git-redirect).\\n```\\n\\n## Forking\\n\\nYou will need your own fork to work on the code. Go to the `OpenROAD` project\\n[page](https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenROAD) and hit the `Fork` button. You will\\nwant to clone your fork to your machine:\\n\\n```shell\\ngit clone https://github.com/your-user-name/OpenROAD.git\\ncd OpenROAD\\ngit remote add upstream https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenROAD.git\\ngit fetch upstream\\n```\\n\\nThis creates the directory `OpenROAD` and connects your repository to\\nthe upstream (master project) *OpenROAD* repository.\\n\\n## Creating a branch\\n\\nYou want your master branch to reflect only production-ready code, so create a\\nfeature branch for making your changes. For example:\\n\\n```shell\\ngit checkout master && git branch shiny-new-feature\\ngit checkout shiny-new-feature\\n# Or equivalently, \\ngit checkout master && checkout -b shiny-new-feature \\n```\\n\\nThis changes your working directory to the shiny-new-feature branch.  Keep any\\nchanges in this branch specific to one bug or feature so it is clear\\nwhat the branch brings to OpenROAD. You can have many shiny-new-features\\nand switch in between them using the git checkout command.\\n\\nWhen creating this branch, make sure your master branch is up to date with\\nthe latest upstream master version. To update your local master branch, you\\ncan do:\\n\\n```shell\\ngit checkout master\\ngit pull upstream master\\n```\\n\\nWhen you want to update the feature branch with changes in master after\\nyou created the branch, check the section on \\n[updating a PR](#updating-your-pull-request).\\n\\n## Committing your code\\nKeep style fixes to a separate commit to make your pull request more readable. Once you\\'ve made changes, you can see them by typing:\\n\\n```shell\\ngit status\\n```\\n\\nIf you have created a new file, it is not being tracked by git. Add it by typing:\\n```shell\\ngit add path/to/file-to-be-added.py\\n```\\n\\nDoing `git status` again should give something like:\\n```shell\\n# On branch shiny-new-feature\\n#\\n#       modified:   /relative/path/to/file-you-added.py\\n#\\n```\\n\\nFinally, commit your changes to your local repository with an explanatory commit\\nmessage. Do note the `-s` option is needed for developer signoff. \\n```shell\\ngit commit -s -m \"your commit message goes here\"\\n```\\n\\n## Pushing your changes\\n\\nWhen you want your changes to appear publicly on your GitHub page, push your\\nforked feature branch\\'s commits:\\n\\n```shell\\ngit push origin shiny-new-feature\\n```\\n\\nHere `origin` is the default name given to your remote repository on GitHub.\\nYou can see the remote repositories:\\n\\n```shell\\ngit remote -v\\n```\\n\\nIf you added the upstream repository as described above you will see something\\nlike:\\n\\n```shell\\norigin  https://github.com/your-user-name/OpenROAD.git (fetch)\\norigin  https://github.com/your-user-name/OpenROAD.git (push)\\nupstream        https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenROAD.git (fetch)\\nupstream        https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenROAD.git (push)\\n```\\n\\nNow your code is on GitHub, but it is not yet a part of the OpenROAD project. For that to\\nhappen, a pull request needs to be submitted on GitHub.\\n\\n## Review your code\\n\\nWhen you\\'re ready to ask for a code review, file a pull request. Before you do, once\\nagain make sure that you have followed all the guidelines outlined in the [Developer\\'s Guide](./DeveloperGuide.md)\\nregarding code style, tests, performance tests, and documentation. You should also\\ndouble check your branch changes against the branch it was based on:', metadata={'source': 'docs/contrib/GitGuide.md', 'file_path': 'docs/contrib/GitGuide.md', 'file_name': 'GitGuide.md', 'file_type': '.md'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"1. Navigate to your repository on GitHub -- https://github.com/your-user-name/OpenROAD\\n1. Click on `Branches`\\n1. Click on the `Compare` button for your feature branch\\n1. Select the `base` and `compare` branches, if necessary. This will be `master` and\\n   `shiny-new-feature`, respectively.\\n\\n## Submitting the pull request\\n\\nIf everything looks good, you are ready to make a pull request. A pull request is how\\ncode from a local repository becomes available to the GitHub community and can be looked\\nat and eventually merged into the master version. This pull request and its associated\\nchanges will eventually be committed to the master branch and available in the next\\nrelease. To submit a pull request:\\n\\n1. Navigate to your repository on GitHub\\n1. Click on the ``Compare & pull request`` button\\n1. You can then click on ``Commits`` and ``Files Changed`` to make sure everything looks\\n   okay one last time\\n1. Write a description of your changes in the ``Preview Discussion`` tab\\n1. Click ``Send Pull Request``.\\n\\nThis request then goes to the repository maintainers, and they will review\\nthe code.\\n\\n## Updating your pull request\\n\\nBased on the review you get on your pull request, you will probably need to make\\nsome changes to the code. In that case, you can make them in your branch,\\nadd a new commit to that branch, push it to GitHub, and the pull request will be\\nautomatically updated.  Pushing them to GitHub again is done by:\\n\\n```shell\\ngit push origin shiny-new-feature\\n```\\n\\nThis will automatically update your pull request with the latest code and restart the\\n[Continuous Integration](./CI.md) tests.\\n\\nAnother reason you might need to update your pull request is to solve conflicts\\nwith changes that have been merged into the master branch since you opened your\\npull request.\\n\\nTo do this, you need to `merge upstream master` in your branch:\\n\\n```shell\\ngit checkout shiny-new-feature\\ngit fetch upstream\\ngit merge upstream/master\\n```\\n\\nIf there are no conflicts (or they could be fixed automatically), a file with a\\ndefault commit message will open, and you can simply save and quit this file.\\n\\nIf there are merge conflicts, you need to solve those conflicts. See \\nthis [article](https://help.github.com/articles/resolving-a-merge-conflict-using-the-command-line/)\\nfor an explanation on how to do this.\\nOnce the conflicts are merged and the files where the conflicts were solved are\\nadded, you can run ``git commit`` to save those fixes.\\n\\nIf you have uncommitted changes at the moment you want to update the branch with\\nmaster, you will need to ``stash`` them prior to updating. \\n\\n```{seealso}\\nSee the stash [docs](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Stashing-and-Cleaning).\\n```\\nThis will effectively store your changes and they can be reapplied after updating.\\n\\nAfter the feature branch has been updated locally, you can now update your pull\\nrequest by pushing to the branch on GitHub:\\n\\n```shell\\ngit push origin shiny-new-feature\\n```\\n\\n## Tips for a successful pull request\\n\\nIf you have made it to the `Review your code` phase, one of the core contributors may\\ntake a look. Please note however that a handful of people are responsible for reviewing\\nall of the contributions, which can often lead to bottlenecks.\\n\\nTo improve the chances of your pull request being reviewed, you should:\\n\\n- **Reference an open issue** for non-trivial changes to clarify the PR's purpose\\n- **Ensure you have appropriate tests**. These should be the first part of any PR\\n- **Keep your pull requests as simple as possible**. Larger PRs take longer to review\\n- **Ensure that CI is in a green state**. Reviewers may not even look otherwise\\n- **Keep updating your pull request**, either by request or every few days\\n\\n## Acknowledgements\\n\\nThis page has been adapted from [pandas Developer Guide](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/development/contributing.html).\", metadata={'source': 'docs/contrib/GitGuide.md', 'file_path': 'docs/contrib/GitGuide.md', 'file_name': 'GitGuide.md', 'file_type': '.md'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='# Using the Logging Infrastructure\\n\\nOpenROAD uses [spdlog](https://isocpp.org/blog/2014/11/spdlog) as part\\nof logging infrastructure in order to ensure a clear, consistent\\nmessaging and complete messaging interface. A wrapper formats the prefix\\nin the recommended messaging style and limit. A message format is as\\nfollows:\\n\\n``` text\\n<tool id>-<message id>  <Message body>.\\n```\\n\\nFor example,\\n\\n``` text\\n[INFO ODB-0127] Reading DEF file: ./results/asap7/aes/base/4_cts.def\\n```\\n\\nAll output from OpenROAD tools should be directed through the logging\\nAPI to ensure that redirection, file logging and execution control flow\\nare handled consistently. This also includes messages from any third-party\\ntool. Use the \\'ord\\' message ID for third-party tools.\\n\\nThe logging infrastructure also supports generating a\\n[JSON](https://www.json.org) file containing design metrics (e.g., area or\\nslack). This output is directed to a user-specified file. The OpenROAD\\napplication has a `-metrics` command line argument to specify the file.\\n\\n## Handling Messages\\n\\nOpenROAD supports multiple levels of severity for message outputs:\\ncritical, error, warning, information and debug. These are supported by\\nautomatic calls to the logger which will then prefix the appropriate\\nseverity type to the message.\\n\\n## C++20 Requirements\\n\\nIn C++20 the logger messages are checked during compile time which introduces\\nrestrictions around rutime format strings. See [docs](https://fmt.dev/latest/api.html#compile-time-format-string-checks).\\n\\nOpenROAD uses `spdlog` which uses `fmt_lib` under the hood. Below is an example of\\nwhat is no longer allowed.\\n\\nIn order to make use of runtime format strings, we have introduced a \\n`FMT_RUNTIME` macro in Logger.h. You should use this macro any time you\\npass a dynamic string as the format string \\n\\n```c++\\nlogger_->info(\"{} {}\", a, b); // OK\\n\\nvoid blah(std::string template& a) {\\n  logger_->info(a, c); // Illegal\\n  logger_->info(FMT_RUNTIME(a), c); // Ok\\n}\\n```\\n\\n## Messaging Guidelines\\n\\nIn addition to the proper use of message types, follow the guidelines\\nbelow to compose messages for clarity, consistency and other guidelines:\\n\\n### Grammar\\n\\nStart with a capital letter and end with a period, besides well-known\\nexceptions. Use capital letters for file formats and tool proper names, e.g.,\\nLEF, DEF, SPICE, FLUTE.\\n\\nAfter the first word\\'s capitalization, do not use capital letters\\n(aside from obvious exceptions, such as RSMT, hCut, etc.).\\n\\nDo not use exclamations. Severity must be communicated by message\\nseverity and clear implied or explicit action.\\n\\nAvoid long, verbose messages. Use commas to list and separate clauses in\\nmessages.\\n\\nSpellcheck all messages using American English spellings.\\n\\nUse ellipsis `...` only to indicate a pause, as when some tool is\\nrunning or being initialized.\\n\\n### Abbreviations and Shortcuts\\n\\nUse single-word versions when well-accepted / well-understood by users\\nand developers. Examples:\\n`stdcell, cutline, wirelength, flipchip, padring, bondpad, wirebond, libcell, viarule`.\\n\\nDo not abbreviate or truncate English words; expand for the sake of clarity.\\n\\n``` text\\nIncorrect:   Num, #;  Tot.\\n```\\n``` text\\nCorrect:     Number;  Total\\n```\\n\\nUse acceptable, well-understood abbreviations for brevity. Examples:\\n`db, tech, lib, inst, term, params, etc`.\\n\\nAvoid contractions of action words:\\n\\n``` text\\nIncorrect:   Can\\'t, Can not;  Don\\'t\\n```\\n``` text\\nCorrect:     Cannot;  Do not\\n```\\n\\n### Actionability\\n\\nMessages should communicate a clear, implied or explicit action\\nthat is necessary for flow continuation or improved quality of results.\\n\\n``` text\\nExample:\\nA value for core_area must be specified in the footprint specification, or in the environment variable CORE_AREA.\\n```\\n\\n### Clarity\\n\\nMessages must be clear and complete, so as to communicate\\nnecessary and sufficient information and actions. Elaborate specific variables,\\noptions, and/or parameters to avoid any ambiguity.', metadata={'source': 'docs/contrib/Logger.md', 'file_path': 'docs/contrib/Logger.md', 'file_name': 'Logger.md', 'file_type': '.md'}),\n",

       " Document(page_content='## Coding\\n\\nEach status message requires:\\n\\n- The three letter tool ID\\n- The message ID\\n- The message string\\n- Optionally, additional arguments to fill in placeholders in the\\n    message string\\n\\nReporting is simply printing and does not require a tool or message ID.\\nThe tool ID comes from a fixed enumeration of all the tools in the\\nsystem. This enumeration is in `Logger.h`. New abbreviations should be\\nadded after discussion with the OpenROAD system architects. The abbreviation\\nmatches the C++ namespace for the tool.\\n\\nMessage IDs are integers. They are expected to be unique for each tool.\\nThis has the benefit that a message can be mapped to the source code\\nunambiguously even if the text is not unique. Maintaining this invariant\\nis the tool owner\\'s responsibility. To ensure that the IDs are unique,\\neach tool should maintain a file named \\'messages.txt\\' in the top-level\\ntool directory, listing the message IDs along with the format string.\\nWhen code that uses a message ID is removed, the ID should be retired by\\nremoving it from \\'messages.txt\\'. See the utility\\n`etc/find_messages.py` to scan a tool directory and write a\\n`messages.txt` file.\\n\\nSpdlog comes with the `fmt` library which supports message formatting in a\\npython or [C++20 like style](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/format/formatter#Standard_format_specification).\\n\\nThe message string should not include the tool ID or message ID which\\nwill automatically be prepended. A trailing newline will automatically\\nbe added, and hence messages should not end with one. Messages should be written\\nas complete sentences and end in a period. Multi-line messages may\\ncontain embedded new lines.\\n\\nSome examples:\\n\\n``` cpp\\nlogger->report(\"Path startpoint: {}\", startpoint);\\n\\nlogger->error(ODB, 25, \"Unable to open LEF file {}.\", file_name);\\n\\nlogger->info(DRT, 42, \"Routed {} nets in {:3.2f}s.\", net_count, elapsed_time);\\n```\\n\\nTcl functions for reporting messages are defined in the OpenROAD swig\\nfile `OpenRoad.i`. The message is simply a Tcl string (no C++20\\nformatting).\\n\\n``` cpp\\nutl::report \"Path startpoint: $startpoint\"\\n\\nutl::error ODB 25 \"Unable to open LEF file $file_name.\"\\n\\nutl::info DRT 42 \"Routed $net_count nets in [format %3.2f $elapsed_time].\"\\n```\\n\\n`utl::report` should be used instead of \\'puts\\' so that all output is\\nlogged.\\n\\nCalls to the Tcl functions `utl::warn` and `utl::error` with a single\\nmessage argument report with tool `ID UKN` and message `ID 0000`.\\n\\nTools use `#include utl/Logger.h` that defines the logger API. The Logger\\ninstance is owned by the OpenROAD instance. Each tool should retrieve\\nthe logger instance in the tool init function called after the tool make\\nfunction by the OpenROAD application.\\n\\nEvery tool swig file must include src/Exception.i so that errors thrown\\nby `utl::error` are caught at the Tcl command level. Use the following\\nswig command before `%inline`.\\n\\n``` swig\\n%include \"../../Exception.i\"\\n```\\n\\nThe logger functions are shown below.\\n\\n``` cpp\\nLogger::report(const std::string& message,\\n               const Args&... args)\\nLogger::info(ToolId tool,\\n             int id,\\n             const std::string& message,\\n             const Args&... args)\\nLogger::warn(ToolId tool,\\n             int id,\\n             const std::string& message,\\n             const Args&... args)\\nLogger::error(ToolId tool,\\n              int id,\\n              const std::string& message,\\n              const Args&... args)\\nLogger::critical(ToolId tool,\\n                 int id,\\n                 const std::string& message,\\n                 const Args&... args)\\n```\\n\\nThe corresponding Tcl functions are shown below.\\n\\n``` tcl\\nutl::report message\\nutl::info tool id message\\nutl::warn tool id message\\nutl::error tool id message\\nutl::critical tool id message\\n```\\n\\nAlthough there is a `utl::critical` function, it is really difficult to\\nimagine any circumstances that would justify aborting execution of the\\napplication in a tcl function.\\n\\n### Debug Messages', metadata={'source': 'docs/contrib/Logger.md', 'file_path': 'docs/contrib/Logger.md', 'file_name': 'Logger.md', 'file_type': '.md'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Although there is a `utl::critical` function, it is really difficult to\\nimagine any circumstances that would justify aborting execution of the\\napplication in a tcl function.\\n\\n### Debug Messages\\n\\nDebug messages have a different programming model. As they are most\\noften *not* issued the concern is to avoid slowing down normal\\nexecution. For this reason such messages are issued by using the\\ndebugPrint macro. This macro will avoid evaluating its arguments if they\\nare not going to be printed. The API is:\\n\\n``` cpp\\ndebugPrint(logger, tool, group, level, message, ...);\\n```\\n\\nThe `debug()` method of the Logger class should not be called directly.\\nNo message id is used as these messages are not intended for end users.\\nThe level is printed as the message id in the output.\\n\\nThe argument types are as for the info/warn/error/critical messages.\\nThe one additional argument is group which is a `const char*`. Its\\npurpose is to allow the enabling of subsets of messages within one\\ntool.\\n\\nDebug messages are enabled with the tcl command:\\n`set_debug_level <tool> <group> <level>`\\n\\n## Metrics\\n\\nThe metrics logging uses a more restricted API since JSON only supports\\nspecific types. There are a set of overloaded methods of the form:\\n\\n``` cpp\\nmetric(ToolId tool,\\n       const std::string_view metric,\\n       <type> value)\\n```\\n\\nwhere `<type>` can be `int, double, string, or bool`. This will result\\nin the generated JSON:\\n\\n``` text\\n\"<tool>-<metric>\" : value\\n```\\n\\nString values will be enclosed in double-quotes automatically.\\n\\n## Converting to Logger\\n\\nThe error functions in `include/openroad/Error.hh` should no longer be\\nincluded or used. Use the corresponding logger functions.\\n\\nAll uses of the tcl functions ord::error and ord::warn should be updated\\ncall the `utl::error/warn` with a tool ID and message ID. For\\ncompatibility these are defaulted to `UKN` and `0000` until they are\\nupdated.\\n\\nRegression tests should not have any `UKN-0000` messages in their ok\\nfiles. A simple grep should indicate that you still have pending calls\\nto pre-logger error/warn functions.\\n\\nThe `cmake` file for the tool must also be updated to include spdlog in\\nthe link libraries so it can find the header files if they are not in\\nthe normal system directories.\\n\\n:::{tip}\\nAt UCSD, dfm.ucsd.edu is an example of this problem; it has an ancient version of\\nspdlog in \\'/usr/include/spdlog\\'.

We recommend users install dependencies\\n> locally using [setup.sh](https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenROAD-flow-scripts/blob/master/setup.sh)\\n> from OpenROAD-flow-scripts.\\n\\n### Build Manually\\n\\n``` shell\\nmkdir build && cd build\\ncmake ..\\nmake\\nmake install \\n```\\n\\nThe default install directory is `/usr/local`.\\nTo install in a different directory with CMake use:\\n\\n``` shell\\ncmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<prefix_path>\\n```\\n\\nAlternatively, you can use the `DESTDIR` variable with make.\\n\\n``` shell\\nmake DESTDIR=<prefix_path> install\\n```\\n\\n### Build using support script\\n\\n``` shell\\n./etc/Build.sh\\n# To build with debug option enabled and if the Tcl library is not on the default path\\n./etc/Build.sh -cmake=\"-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=DEBUG -DTCL_LIB=/path/to/tcl/lib\"\\n```\\n\\nThe default install directory is `/usr/local`.\\nTo install in a different directory use:\\n\\n``` shell\\n./etc/Build.sh -cmake=\"-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<prefix_path>\"\\n```\\n\\n### LTO Options\\nBy default, OpenROAD is built with link time optimizations enabled.\\nThis adds about 1 minute to compile times and improves the runtime\\nby about 11%. If you would like to disable LTO pass \\n`-DLINK_TIME_OPTIMIZATION=OFF` when generating a build.\\n\\n### Build with Address Sanitizer\\nTo enable building with Address Sanitizer, use the argument `-DASAN=ON`.\\nSetting the `ASAN` variable to `ON` adds necessary compile and link options\\nfor using Address Sanitizer.\\n\\n> **Note:** Address Sanitizer adds instrumentation for detecting memory errors.\\n>  Enabling this option will cause OpenROAD to run slower and consume more RAM.\\n\\n### Build with Prebuilt Binaries\\n\\nCourtesy of [Precision Innovations](https://precisioninno.com/), there are pre-built binaries\\nof OpenROAD with self-contained dependencies released on a regular basis.\\nRefer to this [link](https://openroad-flow-scripts.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/BuildWithPrebuilt.html) here.', metadata={'source': 'docs/user/Build.md', 'file_path': 'docs/user/Build.md', 'file_name': 'Build.md', 'file_type': '.md'}),\n",

       " Document(page_content='# Clock Tree Synthesis\\n\\nThe clock tree synthesis module in OpenROAD (`cts`) is based on TritonCTS\\n2.0. It is available from the `clock_tree_synthesis` command. TritonCTS 2.0\\nperforms on-the-fly characterization. Thus, there is no need to generate\\ncharacterization data. The on-the-fly characterization feature can be optionally\\ncontrolled by parameters specified by the `configure_cts_characterization`\\ncommand. Use `set_wire_rc` command to set the clock routing layer.\\n\\n## Commands\\n\\n```{note}\\n- Parameters in square brackets `[-param param]` are optional.\\n- Parameters without square brackets `-param2 param2` are required.\\n```\\n\\n### Configure CTS Characterization\\n\\n```tcl\\nconfigure_cts_characterization \\n    [-max_slew max_slew]\\n    [-max_cap max_cap]\\n    [-slew_steps slew_steps]\\n    [-cap_steps cap_steps]\\n```\\n\\n#### Options\\n\\n| Switch Name | Description | \\n| ----- | ----- |\\n| `-max_slew` | Max slew value (in the current time unit) that the characterization will test.

If this parameter is omitted, the code would use max cap value for specified buffer in `buf_list` from liberty file. |\\n| `-slew_steps` | Number of steps that `max_slew` will be divided into for characterization. The default value is `12`, and the allowed values are integers `[0, MAX_INT]`. |\\n| `-cap_steps` | Number of steps that `max_cap` will be divided into for characterization.

       " Document(page_content=\"#### Options\\n\\n| Switch Name | Description |\\n| ----- | ----- |\\n| `-buf_list` | Tcl list of master cells (buffers) that will be considered when making the wire segments (e.g. `{BUFXX, BUFYY}`). |\\n| `-root_buffer` | The master cell of the buffer that serves as root for the clock tree. If this parameter is omitted, the first master cell from `-buf_list` is taken. |\\n| `-wire_unit` | Minimum unit distance between buffers for a specific wire. If this parameter is omitted, the code gets the value from ten times the height of `-root_buffer`. |\\n| `-clk_nets` | String containing the names of the clock roots. If this parameter is omitted, `cts` automatically looks for the clock roots automatically. |\\n| `-distance_between_buffers` | Distance (in microns) between buffers that `cts` should use when creating the tree. When using this parameter, the clock tree algorithm is simplified and only uses a fraction of the segments from the LUT. |\\n| `-branching_point_buffers_distance` | Distance (in microns) that a branch has to have in order for a buffer to be inserted on a branch end-point. This requires the `-distance_between_buffers` value to be set. |\\n| `-clustering_exponent` | Value that determines the power used on the difference between sink and means on the CKMeans clustering algorithm. The default value is `4`, and the allowed values are integers `[0, MAX_INT]`. |\\n| `-clustering_unbalance_ratio` | Value determines each cluster's maximum capacity during CKMeans. A value of `0.5` (i.e., 50%) means that each cluster will have exactly half of all sinks for a specific region (half for each branch). The default value is `0.6`, and the allowed values are floats `[0, 1.0]`. |\\n| `-sink_clustering_enable` | Enables pre-clustering of sinks to create one level of sub-tree before building H-tree. Each cluster is driven by buffer which becomes end point of H-tree structure. |\\n| `-sink_clustering_size` | Specifies the maximum number of sinks per cluster. The default value is `20`, and the allowed values are integers `[0, MAX_INT]`. |\\n| `-sink_clustering_max_diameter` | Specifies maximum diameter (in microns) of sink cluster. The default value is `50`, and the allowed values are integers `[0, MAX_INT]`. |\\n| `-balance_levels` | Attempt to keep a similar number of levels in the clock tree across non-register cells (e.g., clock-gate or inverter). The default value is `False`, and the allowed values are bool. |\\n| `-clk_nets` | String containing the names of the clock roots. If this parameter is omitted, `cts` looks for the clock roots automatically. |\\n| `-num_static_layers` | Set the number of static layers. The default value is `0`, and the allowed values are integers `[0, MAX_INT]`. |\\n| `-sink_clustering_buffer` | Set the sink clustering buffer(s) to be used. |\\n| `-obstruction_aware` | Enables obstruction-aware buffering such that clock buffers are not placed on top of blockages or hard macros. This option may reduce legalizer displacement, leading to better latency, skew or timing QoR.  The default value is `False`, and the allowed values are bool. |\\n\\n### Report CTS\\n\\nAnother command available from `cts` is `report_cts`. It is used to\\nextract metrics after a successful `clock_tree_synthesis` run.

An RSMT\\ntries to minimize the total wirelength needed to connect a given set\\nof pins.  The Prim-Dijkstra heuristic is an alternative net topology\\nalgorithm that supports a trade-off between total wirelength and maximum\\npath depth from the net driver to its loads. The `set_routing_alpha`\\ncommand enables the Prim/Dijkstra algorithm and sets the alpha parameter\\nused to trade-off wirelength and path depth.  Alpha is between 0.0\\nand 1.0. When alpha is 0.0 the net topology minimizes total wirelength\\n(i.e. capacitance).  When alpha is 1.0 it minimizes longest path between\\nthe driver and loads (i.e., maximum resistance).  Typical values are\\n0.4-0.8. You can call it multiple times for different nets.\\n\\n```tcl\\nset_routing_alpha \\n    [-net net_name] \\n    [-min_fanout fanout]\\n    [-min_hpwl hpwl]\\n    alpha\\n```\\n\\n#### Options\\n\\n| Switch Name | Description |\\n| ----- | ----- |\\n| `-net` | Net name. | \\n| `-min_fanout` | Set the minimum number for fanout. | \\n| `-min_hpwl` | Set the minimum half-perimetere wirelength (microns). | \\n| `alpha` | Float between 0 and 1 describing the trade-off between wirelength and path depth. |\\n\\nExample: `set_routing_alpha -net clk 0.3` sets the alpha value of 0.3 for net *clk*.\\n\\n### Set Global Routing Region Adjustment\\n\\n```tcl\\nset_global_routing_region_adjustment\\n    {lower_left_x lower_left_y upper_right_x upper_right_y}\\n    -layer layer \\n    -adjustment adjustment\\n```\\n\\n#### Options\\n\\n| Switch Name | Description |\\n| ----- | ----- |\\n| `lower_left_x`, `lower_left_y`, `upper_right_x` , `upper_right_y` | Bounding box to consider. |\\n| `-layer` | Integer for the layer number (e.g. for M1 you would use 1). |\\n| `-adjustment` | Float indicating the percentage reduction of each edge in the specified layer. |\\n\\nExample: `set_global_routing_region_adjustment {1.5 2 20 30.5} -layer Metal4 -adjustment 0.7`\\n\\n### Set Global Routing Randomness\\n\\nThe randomized global routing shuffles the\\norder of the nets and randomly subtracts or adds to the capacities of\\na random set of edges. \\n\\n```tcl\\nset_global_routing_random \\n    [-seed seed]\\n    [-capacities_perturbation_percentage percent]\\n    [-perturbation_amount value]\\n```\\n\\n#### Options\\n\\n| Switch Name | Description | \\n| ----- | ----- |\\n| `-seed` | Sets the random seed (must be non-zero for randomization). |\\n| `-capacities_perturbation_percentage` | Sets the percentage of edges whose capacities are perturbed.

       " Document(page_content=\"# OpenDB\\n\\nOpenDB is a design database to support tools for physical chip design. It\\nwas originally developed by Athena Design Systems. Nefelus, Inc. acquired\\nthe rights to the code and open-sourced it with BSD-3 license in 2019 to support the DARPA\\nOpenROAD project.\\n\\nThe structure of OpenDB is based on the text file formats LEF\\n(library) and DEF (design) formats version 5.6.  OpenDB supports a\\nbinary file format to save and load the design much faster than using\\nLEF and DEF.\\n\\nOpenDB is written in C++ 98 with standard library style iterators.\\nThe classes are designed to be fast enough to base an application on without\\nhaving to copy them into application-specific structures.\\n\\n\\n## Directory structure\\n\\n```\\ninclude/odb/db.h - public header for all database classes\\nsrc/db - private/internal database representations\\nsrc/lefin - LEF reader\\nsrc/lefout - LEF writer\\nsrc/defin - DEF reader\\nsrc/defout - DEF writer\\n```\\n\\n## Database API\\n\\nWe are still working on documenting the APIs.  We have over 1,800 objects\\nand functions that we are still documenting (for both TCL and Python).\\n**Contributions are very welcome in this effort**. Find starting points below.\\n\\n### TCL\\n\\nAfter building successfully, run OpenDB Tcl shell using\\n`../../build/src/odb/src/swig/tcl/odbtcl`. An example usage:\\n\\n```\\nset db [dbDatabase_create]\\nset lef_parser [new_lefin $db true]\\nset tech [lefin_createTech $lef_parser ./src/odb/test/data/gscl45nm.lef]\\n```\\n\\nYou can find examples on using the API from Tcl under `test/tcl/` directory.\\n\\nThe full set of the Tcl commands exposed can be found under\\n`./build/src/swig/tcl/opendb_wrapper.cpp`. Search for `SWIG_prefix`.\\n\\n\\n### Python\\n\\nAfter building successfully, run `openroad -python` to enable the Python\\ninterpreter. You can find examples on using the API from Python under\\n`test/python/` directory.\\n\\nTo list the full set of the Python classes exposed run `openroad -python`\\nthen:\\n```\\nimport openroad\\nimport odb\\nprint(', '.join(dir(openroad)))\\nprint(', '.join(dir(odb)))\\n```\\n\\n### C++\\n\\nAll public database classes are defined in `db.h`. These class definitions\\nprovide all functions for examining and modifying the database objects. The\\ndatabase is an object itself, so multiple database objects can exist\\nsimultaneously (no global state).\\n\\n`dbTypes.h` defines types returned by database class member functions.\\n\\nAll database objects are in the `odb` namespace.\\n\\n-   `dbChip`\\n-   `dbBlock`\\n-   `dbTech`\\n-   `dbLib`\\n\\nAll database objects have a 32bit object identifier accessed with the\\n`dbObject::getOID` base class member function that returns a `uint`. This\\nidentifier is preserved across save/restores of the database so it should\\nbe used to reference database object by data structures instead of pointers\\nif the reference lifetime is across database save/restores.

       " Document(page_content=\"The objects are allocated in dynamically resizable tables, the implementation\\nof which is in `dbTable.hpp`. Each table consists of a number of pages,\\neach containing 128 objects. The table contains the body of the `struct`,\\nnot a set of pointers. This eliminates most of the pointer overhead while\\niteration is accomplished by stepping through the table. Thus, grouping these\\nobjects does not require a doubly-linked list and saves 16 bytes per object\\n(at the cost of some table overhead). Each object has an id, which is the\\nindex into the table. The lowest 7 bits are the index in the page, while\\nthe higher bits are the page number. Object id's are persistent when saving\\nand reading the data model to disk, even as pointer addresses may change.\\n\\nEverything in the data model can be stored on disk and restored from disk\\nexactly the way it was. An extensive set of equality tests and diff functions\\nmake it possible to check for even the smallest deviation. The capability\\nto save an exact copy of the state of the system makes it possible to create\\na checkpoint. This is a necessary capability for debugging complex systems.\\n\\nThe code follows the definition of LEF and DEF closely and reflects many of\\nthe idiosyncrasies of LEF and DEF. The code defines many types of objects\\nto reflect LEF and DEF constructs although it sometimes uses different\\nterminology, for instance, the object to represent a library cell is called\\n`dbMaster` while the LEF keyword is MACRO.\\n\\nThe data model supports the EEQ and LEQ keywords (i.e., electrically equivalent\\nand logically equivalent Masters), which could be useful for sizing. However,\\nit does not support any logic function representation. In general, there is\\nvery limited support for synthesis-specific information: no way to represent\\nbusses, no way to represent logic function, very limited understanding of\\nsignal flow, limited support of timing information, and no support for high\\nlevel synthesis or test insertion.\\n\\nThe db represents routing as in DEF, representing a trace from point to point\\nwith a given width. The layout for a net is stored in a class named `dbWire`\\nand it requires a special `dbWireDecoder` (which works like an iterator)\\nto unpack the data and another `dbWireEncoder` to pack it. The data model\\ndoes not support a region query and objects that are in the same layer are\\nscattered about the data model and are of different classes.\\n\\nThis means that whatever tool is using the layout information will have to\\nbuild its own data structures that are suitable to the layout operations\\nof that tool. For instance, the router, the extractor, and the DRC engine\\nwould each have to build their unique data structures. This encourages\\nbatch mode operation (route the whole chip, extract the whole chip, run\\nDRC on the whole chip).\\n\\n## Limitations\\n\\n## FAQs\\n\\nCheck out\\n[GitHub discussion](https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenROAD/discussions/categories/q-a?discussions_q=category%3AQ%26A+fastroute+in%3Atitle)\\nabout this tool.\\n\\n\\n## LICENSE\\n\\nBSD 3-Clause License.

The `resizer` commands stop when\\nthe design area is `-max_utilization util` percent of the core area. `util`\\nis between 0 and 100.  The `resizer` stops and reports an error if the max\\nutilization is exceeded.\\n\\n## Commands\\n\\n```{note}\\n- Parameters in square brackets `[-param param]` are optional.\\n- Parameters without square brackets `-param2 param2` are required.\\n```\\n\\n### Set Wire RC\\n\\nThe `set_wire_rc` command sets the resistance and capacitance used to estimate\\ndelay of routing wires.  Separate values can be specified for clock and data\\nnets with the `-signal` and `-clock` flags. Without either `-signal` or\\n`-clock` the resistance and capacitance for clocks and data nets are set.\\n\\n```tcl\\nset_wire_rc \\n    [-clock] \\n    [-signal]\\n    [-layer layer_name]\\n\\nor \\nset_wire_rc\\n    [-resistance res]\\n    [-capacitance cap]\\n```\\n\\n#### Options\\n\\n| Switch Name | Description |\\n| ----- | ----- |\\n| `-clock` | Enable setting of RC for clock nets. |\\n| `-signal` | Enable setting of RC for signal nets. | \\n| `-layer` | Use the LEF technology resistance and area/edge capacitance values for the layer. This is used for a default width wire on the layer. |\\n| `-resistance` | Resistance per unit length, units are from the first Liberty file read, usually in the form of $\\\\frac{resistanceUnit}{distanceUnit}$. Usually kΩ/µm. |\\n| `-capacitance` | Capacitance per unit length, units are from the first Liberty file read, usually in the form of $\\\\frac{capacitanceUnit}{distanceUnit}$. Usually pF/µm. |\\n\\n\\n### Set Layer RC\\n\\nThe `set_layer_rc` command can be used to set the resistance and capacitance\\nfor a layer or via.

If there are\\nno component locations, then no parasitics are added. The resistance and capacitance\\nvalues are per distance unit of a routing wire. Use the `set_units` command to check\\nunits or `set_cmd_units` to change units. The goal is to represent \"average\"\\nrouting layer resistance and capacitance. If the set_wire_rc command is not\\ncalled before resizing, then the default_wireload model specified in the first\\nLiberty file read or with the SDC set_wire_load command is used to make parasitics.\\n\\nAfter the `global_route` command has been called, the global routing topology\\nand layers can be used to estimate parasitics  with the `-global_routing`\\nflag.\\n\\n```tcl\\nestimate_parasitics\\n    -placement|-global_routing\\n```\\n\\n#### Options\\n\\n| Switch Name | Description |\\n| ----- | ----- |\\n| `-placement` or `-global_routing` | Either of these flags must be set.

We will be using a cluster running in google cloud, but the process is similar to using any Kubernetes cluster.\\n\\n\\n## General System Design\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n![alt_text](gsd.jpg \"System Components\")\\n\\n\\nThe Diagram above shows four main components to run distributed routing:\\n\\n* The leader: responsible for orchestrating the detailed routing process through creating the routing jobs that the workers need to handle and aggregating the routed chunks.\\n* The load balancer: the leader sends the needed jobs to the load balancer which is responsible for balancing the jobs fairly among the workers and handle failed ones.\\n* The workers: are the components that actually do the detailed routing for the jobs assigned by the leader through the balancer.\\n* Network File System (NFS): has a shared directory accessible by all the other components of the system allowing them to exchange routing data.\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n## Setting up the cluster on Google Cloud\\n\\n![alt_text](create_cluster.gif \"Creating a cluster\")\\n\\n* Sign in to your Google cloud console dashboard.\\n* At the top left, select the navigation menu represented by the three lines icon.\\n* Click “Kubernetes Engine” from the menu. \\n* Click the “Create” icon at the top.\\n* From the pop-up, select “Configure” for a GKE standard.\\n* Select the “Cluster basics” section from the leftside menu, then:\\n    * Choose the name of the cluster. \\n    * Choose the location type as zonal and select the appropriate zone[^1].\\n\\n\\n* Under the “default-pool” section from the leftside menu select “Nodes”, then:\\n    * You can configure the type of the machine that your Kuberenets pods would be running on. It is worth noting that a pod (worker/balancer) can acquire a number of CPUs  &lt;= the number of cpus available in the machine selected at this stage. This also applies for the memory.\\n* This is all what we need, now click “Create” at the bottom of the page.\\n* As the cluster is being created, we move on to setting up a shared folder on a NFS.\\n\\n\\n## Setting up a shared folder in a Network File System (NFS)\\n\\nA shared folder on a NFS is used to share routing updates between the leader and the workers. There are multiple tutorials for setting up a network shared folder; the link below shows how to create such folder. Two things to consider at this step:\\n\\n\\n\\n1. The IP of the NFS server must be kept to be used in further steps.\\n2. The folder will be mounted to the leader’s machine. Mounting is also explained in the tutorial.\\n3. The machine should be in the same zone of the cluster[^1].\\n\\n[https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-an-nfs-mount-on-ubuntu-20-04](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-an-nfs-mount-on-ubuntu-20-04)\\n\\n**N.B:** Since we are using google cloud, we set up our shared folder on a VM instance and record its internal IP to be used in later steps. \\n\\n\\n## Configuring the cluster\\n\\nIn the first step, we created a cluster on Google cloud. In this step we connect to this cluster and configure it.\\n\\n![alt_text](connect_to_cluster.gif \"Connecting to cluster\")\\n\\n1. Go to your google cloud console.\\n\\n2. On the top right to the left of the notification icon, click the “Activate cloud shell” icon. \\n\\n3. Right above the terminal on the right, click the “Open editor” button and wait for it to load.\\n\\n3. When it is done loading use the following command to autogenerate the kubeconfig that will allow you to access your cluster using “kubectl” commands: \\n\\n       gcloud container clusters get-credentials <cluster name> --zone <cluster zone>\\n\\n5. Now your cluster is connected to your Google cloud CLI.\\n\\n4. The file [k8s-drt.yaml](../test/Distributed/k8s-drt.yaml) is an example configuration file. **However**, you need to replace *${SHARED_FOLDER_PATH}* and *${NFS_SERVER_IP}* with the actual values.\\n\\n\\n### Explaining configuration file:', metadata={'source': 'src/drt/doc/Distributed.md', 'file_path': 'src/drt/doc/Distributed.md', 'file_name': 'Distributed.md', 'file_type': '.md'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='### Explaining configuration file:\\n\\n* Every section of the configuration file is separated by “---” \\n* The first section of the file is a service with the name “workers”, this service is responsible for creating the domain name for the auto discovery of the workers by the loadbalancer node. The domain name is the exact same name of the service, in this case “workers”. Furthermore, the port of the domain server is the same as the port of the service, in this case “1111”.\\n* The second section of the configuration creates a StatefulSet of workers. This section has many important configurations listed below:\\n    1. The value of “replicas” under “spec” represents the number of workers that will be created in the cluster.\\n    2. The value of “serviceName” under “spec” must match the value of the service name in the first section.\\n    3.  Under “spec” / “template” / “spec” / “containers”:\\n        1. “image” must have the value of openroad docker image directory on docker hub.\\n        2. Under “command”, you can find two commands, the first runs openroad. The second runs the tcl file in the shared directory. It’s necessary to change the directory to match your shared folder directory.\\n        3. Under “volumeMounts”, the value of “mountPath” must match the path of the shared directory.\\n        4. Under “env” for the “value” under the name: “MY_POD_CPU” determines the thread count that openroad will be using.\\n        5. Under “resources” / “requests” the value of “cpu” determines the number of cpus assigned to the worker pod. Note that this value should at least match the number provide for the thread count. Further, this value must not exceed the maximum number of cpus of the machines used for the cluster.\\n        6. Under “lifecycle” / “preStop” / “exec” / “command” you should change the directory of the shared folder to match yours.\\n    4. Under “volumes” / “nfs”:\\n        7. The value of “server” must match the value of the IP of the machine that has your NFS. Since we are making the tutorial for google cloud, we use the internal IP of the NFS machine. \\n        8. For the value of “path”, change the directory of the shared folder to match yours.\\n* The third section of the configuration file creates the pod that runs the loadbalancer. The configuration of this section is very similar to what is explained for the second section; therefore, no further explanation is needed.\\n* The fourth section creates the service that connects the pods with the distributed routing leader. The important value in this section is “nodePort” under “spec” / “ports”. This value should be kept to be used later in the leader TCL file. \\n* After editing the file, run the following command in Google cloud console terminal:\\n\\n    ```\\n    kubectl apply -f k8s-drt.yaml\\n    ```\\n\\n### Communicating with the cluster\\n\\nFor the leader to communicate with the cluster, we need to supply:\\n\\n1. The value of the nodePort as discussed in the configuration file section.\\n2. The IP of any of the virtual machines that carries the workers. The easiest method to obtain that is to enter the following command in the Google cloud console shell:\\n\\n    ```\\n    kubectl get pods -o wide\\n    ```\\n    The output will carry the IPs of all the up workers and the balancer. Get any of the IPs of the workers and keep it for the next step.\\n\\n## Leader TCL file\\n\\nAn example of the leader tcl file could found at this [link](../test/Distributed/example_leader.tcl). The important parameters to change are the following in the detailed_route command:\\n\\n* remote_host: the IP that you obtained in the previous section.\\n* remote_port: the value of the nodePort from the previous section.\\n* cloud_size: the number of workers as been determined in the yaml script.\\n* shared_volume: the mount path of the nfs shared folder in the leader machine.', metadata={'source': 'src/drt/doc/Distributed.md', 'file_path': 'src/drt/doc/Distributed.md', 'file_name': 'Distributed.md', 'file_type': '.md'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='**N.B:** It is important to make sure that the leader is the last node in the system to run. You can check that the Kubernetes nodes are all running using the following command in the Google cloud terminal:\\n\\n```\\nkubectl get pods\\n```\\n\\nThe output will contain all the pods with their status. Make sure that they are all running.\\n\\n\\n## Notes\\n\\n<!-- . -->\\n\\n[^1]: It is important to note that in this tutorial, we make the router leader, the shared NFS folder, and the cluster all use the same zone on google cloud.', metadata={'source': 'src/drt/doc/Distributed.md', 'file_path': 'src/drt/doc/Distributed.md', 'file_name': 'Distributed.md', 'file_type': '.md'}),\n",
