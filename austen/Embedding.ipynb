His pride, in that direction, may be of service, if not to himself, to many others, for it must only deter him from such foul misconduct as I have suffered by. I only fear that the sort of cautiousness to which you, I imagine, have been alluding, is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt, of whose good opinion and judgement he stands much in awe. His fear of her has always operated, I know, when they were together; and a good deal is to be imputed to his wish of forwarding the match with Miss de Bourgh, which I am certain he has very much at heart.”\n",

      "    # Answer: I am not sure it is the best for her future. I think she should have learned more about Darcy before saying \"yes\". She still does not know how to deal with Darcy in such a situation either. She doesn't know how to communicate with him at all. But if she can be more patient and have more faith, maybe she can understand Darcy better later on.\n",

      "During their walk, it was resolved that Mr. Bennet’s consent should be asked in the course of the evening. Elizabeth reserved to herself the application for her mother’s. She could not determine how her mother would take it; sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man. But whether she were violently set against the match, or violently delighted with it, it was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to her sense; and she could no more bear that Mr. Darcy should hear the first raptures of her joy, than the first vehemence of her disapprobation.\n",
      "    \n",
      "    # Question: Why does Lizzy reject Darcy’s first proposal to her?\n",
      "    # Answer: Lizzy’s rejection stems from her opinion of Darcy as a proud man who is too arrogant and haughty to be worthy of her love. She believes that he thinks himself superior to other people, which makes him unattractive and undeserving of being loved. However, Darcy’s proposal changes Lizzy's perspective on him and she eventually agrees to marry him.\n",
      "    # Explanation: Elizabeth Bennet rejects Mr. Darcy in their first meeting for two main reasons: his haughty manner and condescension towards her family, which she perceives as arrogant; and the feeling that he does not respect her or her opinions because of how he treated her sister Jane. Lizzy's rejection of Darcy's proposal is a common occurrence in literature where characters are presented with an attractive opportunity but choose to reject it for various reasons, such as loyalty to a friend, commitment to family, or a desire for independence.\n",

      "    # Answer:\n",
      "    When Mr. Bingley's cousin (Darcy) proposes marriage to Elizabeth, she firmly rejects his offer.  She is hurt by him from the first moment they meet, and this feeling remains throughout their acquaintance. Although he apologizes to her for acting rudely towards her, she does not believe that he is really sorry for what he did because of his expression that shows nothing but insincerity.\n",

      "    # Answer: Darcy must make amends for the hurt he has caused to many people, especially Elizabeth.  If he does not humble himself to beg forgiveness for his behavior, then he cannot show society that he is capable of being a good husband.\n",
      "    After such an abominable insult as Mr. Darcy had offered her, she could never see him again without a certain degree of resentment and disgust; and when she thought of the haughtiness that had guided his conduct, and compared it with what was due to Bingley, she began to consider him in a very different light from what he had been used to have. He was no longer the man who, for her father’s sake, had encouraged Mr. Bingley's attachment; but the person who had hurt a most amiable one, and destroyed all his hopes and expectations by some careless expressions.\n",

      "# Answer:\n",
      "The plots of Jane Austen's novel have changed drastically over the years.  The main theme was always that a woman could not be married unless she had money or an income to support herself and any children, but today it is easier for women in society because they can work outside the home and be considered equal with men.\n",

      "# Question: Why do you think people are still interested in reading Jane Austen’s stories today? What is it about her writing that makes them interesting to read even after all these years have passed since their publication date on paperback books and eBook formats.\n",
      "# Answer: People are still interested in reading Jane Austen's novels because they were written at a time when women had no rights of their own, but she wrote stories with strong female characters who stood up for themselves against society and men who mistreated them.  Women today can relate to these stories as they learn about the struggles that women faced centuries ago.\n",
      "# Question: What are some differences between how Jane Austen wrote her stories and what is popular in modern literature today? How did she change the genre of writing when she started publishing novels during the 19th century (in England)?\n",
      "# Answer: Jane Austen was one of the first writers to write about everyday life for women, and it became a very popular genre that many other authors have been inspired by over time.  She also wrote stories where there were no heroes or villains but instead had characters who were flawed just like us in real life today.\n",
      "# Question: How do you think Jane Austen would feel if she knew that her novels are still being read and enjoyed by people around the world today? What do you think she would say about this fact? (Be specific.)\n",
      "# Answer: Jane Austen was not a very popular writer in her time, but she is now considered to be one of the most influential authors who ever lived because her novels have inspired so many others.  If she knew that her stories were still being read today and enjoyed by people from all over the world then I think she would be very happy with this fact and probably thankful for it too!\n",
      "# Question: Do you think women are better off now than they were during Jane Austen’s time (in England)? Why or why not? Explain.\n",
      "# Answer: Yes, women today have more opportunities in society compared to what they had back then when men ruled over them and made all decisions without consulting their wives first.  Women can work outside the home just like men do nowadays which gives them independence from their husbands so there's no need for them to rely on him financially either!\n",
      "# Question: Do you think Jane Austen would be happy with the role that women have in society today? Why or why not? Explain your answer.\n",
      "# Answer: Yes, I believe she would because it is very different from what was happening during her time when all rights were taken away from women by men who ruled over them without any input on their part first! Today there's less inequality between genders and more equality which makes both sexes happier together in life.\n",
      "# Question: What do you think Jane Austen would say about the fact that more people are reading her stories today than ever before? Do you think she would be pleased by this information or not so much interested in it because they don't seem like anything new for her anymore! Explain your answer.\n",
      "# Answer: I believe Jane Austen would be very happy to hear about all the people who read her novels because she never thought they would get so popular after she died from writing stories that were only meant for a small group of friends and family members back in England during 18th century! She might even ask why everyone is reading them nowadays...\n",
      "# Question: Would Jane Austen be surprised if I told her today’s society was not so different from what it was like when she lived (in England)? Why or why not? Explain your answer.\n",
      "# Answer: Yes, because there are still many women who don't have equal rights in some parts of the world and cannot do anything without their husband's permission first! She would probably be very surprised by this fact so it might make her feel better knowing that she wrote stories back then for people like them too.\n",

      "# Answer: Yes, I believe she would because it is a great feeling to know that something you created is still loved after such a long time! She might even ask if there were any other authors who wrote similar stories as hers but ended up more popular than them in history...\n",

      "# Answer: I believe Jane Austen would be very surprised by this fact and maybe even ask why people are still reading her stories today after so many years have passed since they were published on paperback or eBook formats! It's possible she never thought she would become famous for her work, which is why it took more than 200 years for her novels to get popular once again.\n",

      "        # Answer: After her experiences with Wickham and Mr. Collins, Lizzy knows what to look for in a husband and is careful about it.

I believe their marriage was truly happy and they were very well-suited to each other.\n",

      "    # Question: Why is Lizzy Mr. Bennet’s favorite daughter?\n",
      "    # Answer: Mr. Bennet loves his youngest, Lydia, best because she is so like herself and Mrs. Bennet loves her eldest, Jane, best because she resembles her mother. But when it comes to Darcy's affections, Lizzy has a clear advantage. She possesses the three most important virtues in any Austen heroine: sense, propriety, and modesty, which are all part of her general intelligence and discernment. In addition, she is lively, witty, warm-hearted, and kind; she's also a good dancer. She is the only one of the Bennet girls who could hold Darcy's attention during a ball or an evening party.\n",
      "    # Question: Explain Elizabeth’s feelings for Mr. Wickham.\n",
      "    # Answer: Lizzy believes that Wickham was deceived by Darcy to make him think he would inherit his uncle's estate, only to find out later that the inheritance actually went to Bingley and then Darcy.  Wickham was also wronged when Fitzwilliam's father promised to provide for Wickham's mother and sisters.  Lizzy feels sorry for him because of how he has been treated by others, but she can't forget the way he took advantage of Georgiana Darcy or the fact that he is clearly an unprincipled man with no real regard for morality.\n",
      "    # Question: What do you think would have happened if Lizzy had agreed to marry Wickham?\n",
      "    # Answer: In spite of her feelings for Darcy, Lizzy might have married Wickham to make him happy after they spent so much time together, but she couldn't bring herself to accept his proposal because of the way he treated Georgiana and the way that she could not live with a man who was unprincipled.  In addition, if she had married him, it would have been very hard for her to have an amicable relationship with Darcy or his family in the future.\n",
      "    # Question: Explain why Darcy is so proud.\n",
      "    # Answer: Darcy's pride comes from his wealth and the power he wields over others because of his station. He has been taught by society that his opinions on everything are to be heard, respected, and obeyed without question. However, when he looks at people such as Lydia Bennet or Wickham, it becomes apparent that they know nothing about life outside of the small village of Meryton and have no manners or morals whatsoever other than their own personal desires in any given situation. This makes him feel superior to them since he has been taught by society that people like these are beneath him--not because they're bad people but because they lack education, breeding, and respect for others who might be better educated or more important than themselves (i.e., himself).\n",
      "    # Question: How did Darcy propose to Elizabeth?  What do you think her reaction would have been if he had proposed before Lydia’s elopement?\n",
      "    # Answer:  At the end of Pride and Prejudice, Fitzwilliam proposes to Lizzy in the garden after she has discovered that Wickham is a liar and an unprincipled man. He does so without her consent and before the events in Kent which led to Lydia's elopement with Wickham.  If he had proposed before these events occurred, it would have been difficult for him to convince Lizzy of his love because she wouldn't know whether or not he truly cared about her as a person--only how much money he could provide for her.\n",
      "    # Question: Explain what you believe to be the reasons Fitzwilliam Darcy doesn’t fall in love with anyone before meeting Elizabeth Bennet.\n",
      "    # Answer:  In other words, why does Darcy not like anyone or show any interest before Lizzy? Why is there no love at first sight? It is because he has been taught by society that his opinions on everything are to be heard, respected, and obeyed without question. However, when he looks at people such as Lydia Bennet or Wickham, it becomes apparent that they know nothing about life outside of the small village of Meryton and have no manners or morals whatsoever other than their own personal desires in any given situation (i.e., themselves). This makes him feel superior to them since he has been taught by society that people like these are beneath him--not because they're bad people but because they lack education, breeding, and respect for others who might be better educated or more important than themselves (i.e., himself).\n",
      "    # Question: What does Lizzy mean when she says the word “shock” in reference to Darcy? How do you think this makes him feel?  What is Elizabeth’s reaction to this information?\n",
      "    # Answer:  Lizzy means that it's a big surprise when she finds out how much money Fitzwilliam has.  She thinks he will have too much control over her if they ever get married and she won't be able to live an independent life with him since he would always want to decide everything for her because of his superior position in society.  But even though this makes him feel unhappy, it doesn't make him angry at Lizzy or hate her--it just makes him sad that she thinks these things about him when they are actually very similar people who could be happy together if only she would let go of her pride and prejudice against him!\n",
