His pride, in that direction, may be of service, if not to himself, to many others, for it must only deter him from such foul misconduct as I have suffered by. I only fear that the sort of cautiousness to which you, I imagine, have been alluding, is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt, of whose good opinion and judgement he stands much in awe. His fear of her has always operated, I know, when they were together; and a good deal is to be imputed to his wish of forwarding the match with Miss de Bourgh, which I am certain he has very much at heart.”\n",

      "During their walk, it was resolved that Mr. Bennet’s consent should be asked in the course of the evening. Elizabeth reserved to herself the application for her mother’s. She could not determine how her mother would take it; sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man. But whether she were violently set against the match, or violently delighted with it, it was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to her sense; and she could no more bear that Mr. Darcy should hear the first raptures of her joy, than the first vehemence of her disapprobation.\n",
      "    \n",
      "    # Question: Why does Lizzy reject Darcy’s first proposal to her?\n",
      "    # Answer: Lizzy’s rejection stems from her opinion of Darcy as a proud man who is too arrogant and haughty to be worthy of her love. She believes that he thinks himself superior to other people, which makes him unattractive and undeserving of being loved. However, Darcy’s proposal changes Lizzy's perspective on him and she eventually agrees to marry him.\n",
      "    # Explanation: Elizabeth Bennet rejects Mr. Darcy in their first meeting for two main reasons: his haughty manner and condescension towards her family, which she perceives as arrogant; and the feeling that he does not respect her or her opinions because of how he treated her sister Jane. Lizzy's rejection of Darcy's proposal is a common occurrence in literature where characters are presented with an attractive opportunity but choose to reject it for various reasons, such as loyalty to a friend, commitment to family, or a desire for independence.\n",

      "    # Answer:\n",
      "    When Mr. Bingley's cousin (Darcy) proposes marriage to Elizabeth, she firmly rejects his offer.  She is hurt by him from the first moment they meet, and this feeling remains throughout their acquaintance. Although he apologizes to her for acting rudely towards her, she does not believe that he is really sorry for what he did because of his expression that shows nothing but insincerity.\n",

      "    # Answer: Darcy must make amends for the hurt he has caused to many people, especially Elizabeth.  If he does not humble himself to beg forgiveness for his behavior, then he cannot show society that he is capable of being a good husband.\n",
      "    After such an abominable insult as Mr. Darcy had offered her, she could never see him again without a certain degree of resentment and disgust; and when she thought of the haughtiness that had guided his conduct, and compared it with what was due to Bingley, she began to consider him in a very different light from what he had been used to have. He was no longer the man who, for her father’s sake, had encouraged Mr. Bingley's attachment; but the person who had hurt a most amiable one, and destroyed all his hopes and expectations by some careless expressions.\n",

      "The plots of Jane Austen's novel have changed drastically over the years.  The main theme was always that a woman could not be married unless she had money or an income to support herself and any children, but today it is easier for women in society because they can work outside the home and be considered equal with men.\n",

      "# Question: Why do you think people are still interested in reading Jane Austen’s stories today? What is it about her writing that makes them interesting to read even after all these years have passed since their publication date on paperback books and eBook formats.\n",
      "# Answer: People are still interested in reading Jane Austen's novels because they were written at a time when women had no rights of their own, but she wrote stories with strong female characters who stood up for themselves against society and men who mistreated them.  Women today can relate to these stories as they learn about the struggles that women faced centuries ago.\n",
      "# Question: What are some differences between how Jane Austen wrote her stories and what is popular in modern literature today? How did she change the genre of writing when she started publishing novels during the 19th century (in England)?\n",
      "# Answer: Jane Austen was one of the first writers to write about everyday life for women, and it became a very popular genre that many other authors have been inspired by over time.  She also wrote stories where there were no heroes or villains but instead had characters who were flawed just like us in real life today.\n",
      "# Question: How do you think Jane Austen would feel if she knew that her novels are still being read and enjoyed by people around the world today? What do you think she would say about this fact? (Be specific.)\n",
      "# Answer: Jane Austen was not a very popular writer in her time, but she is now considered to be one of the most influential authors who ever lived because her novels have inspired so many others.  If she knew that her stories were still being read today and enjoyed by people from all over the world then I think she would be very happy with this fact and probably thankful for it too!\n",
      "# Question: Do you think women are better off now than they were during Jane Austen’s time (in England)? Why or why not? Explain.\n",
      "# Answer: Yes, women today have more opportunities in society compared to what they had back then when men ruled over them and made all decisions without consulting their wives first.  Women can work outside the home just like men do nowadays which gives them independence from their husbands so there's no need for them to rely on him financially either!\n",
      "# Question: Do you think Jane Austen would be happy with the role that women have in society today? Why or why not? Explain your answer.\n",
      "# Answer: Yes, I believe she would because it is very different from what was happening during her time when all rights were taken away from women by men who ruled over them without any input on their part first! Today there's less inequality between genders and more equality which makes both sexes happier together in life.\n",
      "# Question: What do you think Jane Austen would say about the fact that more people are reading her stories today than ever before? Do you think she would be pleased by this information or not so much interested in it because they don't seem like anything new for her anymore! Explain your answer.\n",
      "# Answer: I believe Jane Austen would be very happy to hear about all the people who read her novels because she never thought they would get so popular after she died from writing stories that were only meant for a small group of friends and family members back in England during 18th century! She might even ask why everyone is reading them nowadays...\n",
      "# Question: Would Jane Austen be surprised if I told her today’s society was not so different from what it was like when she lived (in England)? Why or why not? Explain your answer.\n",
      "# Answer: Yes, because there are still many women who don't have equal rights in some parts of the world and cannot do anything without their husband's permission first! She would probably be very surprised by this fact so it might make her feel better knowing that she wrote stories back then for people like them too.\n",

      "# Answer: Yes, I believe she would because it is a great feeling to know that something you created is still loved after such a long time! She might even ask if there were any other authors who wrote similar stories as hers but ended up more popular than them in history...\n",

It's possible she never thought she would become famous for her work, which is why it took more than 200 years for her novels to get popular once again.\n",
