# Jane Austen Proof-of-concept

The goal of this is to use Retrieval Augmented Generation, or RAG, 
to generate some semblance of Austen's works by simply ingesting the 
entire written collection into vector database.

## Todo
- Download database
- Embed database using cpu-friendly methods
- Connect database to GCP Vertex AI
- Use Vertex AI to do prompt search.
